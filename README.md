Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Simon. I'm a developer with a passion for iOS and building tools for developers.

I'm working on [Scriptable](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188), [Jayson](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jayson/id1447750768), and [Data Jar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/data-jar/id1453273600) but these days [I'm spending most of my spare time building Runestone](https://twitter.com/simonbs/status/1390021950643314693), a performant text editor for iOS with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and much more. The core of Runestone will be open-sourced as a Swift package.

You can reach me on Twitter where I'm [@simonbs](https://twitter.com/simonbs).
